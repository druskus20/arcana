# arcana

Collection of undocumented spells that you probably should not use.

Or in other words, internal libraries that I use across various personal projects

- **glados**: task manager that (hopefully) abstracts over OS threads and Tokio tasks.
- **hermes**: message broker for actors
- **argus**: small abstraction over `tokio/tracing`
- **quill**: basic text formatting utilities for the cli (bold, underline, etc.)
- **spells**: tiny bits of code and extension traits that I would otherwise end up rewriting  across projects
